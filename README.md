# UVa Problems
Repository for solving UVa problems.<br/>
Some problems may not provide an acceptable answer on UVa, but I still pushed the code for future reference.
Unsolved problems will be marked accordingly.<br/>
All of the problems statements can be found [here] (https://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php) or with a quick Google search.<br/>
